Set up Maven
1. Maven Config -> pom.xml
   -> Make sure the dependency is correct (Each DB add its own dependency in pom.xml)
   -> If still have red word waring in importing classes -> (pom.xml--> Add as Maven Project)
2. Java Class, write the operations
3. exec Maven
   -> mvn clean compile
   -> mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="mongo.MongoDBMain"

Set up DB's (Can share the same Maven)
1. Create package for each DB
2. In each package, create the class to connect with the DB

Mongo DB
1. docker exec -it mongodb mongo (Access the DB in docker)
2. show dbs // Check which databases are available
   use testDB // Switch to the database that just used or wanted to read
   show collections // View the collections in this DB (collection similar to Table in SQLDB)
   db.users.find() // Query all records in the users collection

Redis DB
1. docker exec -it redis redis-cli
2.
